# Exam Information

This document provides important information about the upcoming exam for the BMED365 course.

## Date and Time
The digital home exam will take place on Monday Feb 26th 2024 13:00-15:00.

## Location and Preparation
The digital home exam will take place in [Inspera](https://www.inspera.com). Please make sure you are able to login to [UiB/Inspera](https://vurdering.uib.no) at least 15 minutes before the scheduled start time (more details at https://www.uib.no/en/student/125772/preparing-exams). Note: In addition to preparing yourself academically, you must also remember to check that your computer and login are ready to use at the examination. This is your responsibility as a student.

## Exam Format

- The **two hours** digital home exam in BMED365 on Inspera consists of **eight multiple-choice questions**, each with five answer options, where there are two answers being "the most correct". 

- This is followed by **two free-text essay questions**. 

- The eight MCQ questions and the two essay questions are given in both **English** and **Norsk bokm√•l**. 

- **All aids are allowed** but specify precisely which aids you have had access to and how you used these sources (look-up, search, prompt) in your submitted answers. The exam allows the use of AI to understand and explain medical AI.

- The **topics covered** from the course syllabus (lectures, readings, and assignments) in the MCQ-section and in the two essay questions are among the following (_no coding is expected_): 


  - The equation $y \approx f(\mathbf{X}, \theta)$
  - Image classification, object detection, and image segmentation (semantic segmentation, instance segmentation)
  - Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning
  - Patient similarity networks (PSNs)
  - Large language models (LLMs), multimodal foundation models; tokens, embeddings, transformers, and the concept of prompt engineering
  - Imaging modalities e.g., MRI, CT, PET, and live cell imaging, imaging mass cytometry (IMC)
  - The role of Python in AI and computational modeling
  - Performance measures of predictive models (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Dice score)
  - The role of AI in experimental biomedicine (wet lab, dry lab, moist lab) and in clinical science (precision medicine, personalized medicine, P4 medicine)
  - Computational modeling of biological systems (e.g., compartment models, ODEs, PDEs, networks, and graphs)
  - Imaging-derived biomarkers and imaging-based parameter estimation
  - Explainable AI, ethical AI, regulations in AI, human-in-the-loop AI
  - Future perspectives and challenges using AI in biomedicine and health (drug discovery, self-driving labs, prompting proteins, patient similarity networks, diagnostic reasoning, and problem-solving)
  


## Exam Rules
- For the 8 **MCQ questions** with 5 answer options each, you will get 3 points for exactly 1 correct answer, 5 points for 2 correct answers, 0 points otherwise.

- For each of the two **essay questions**, a particularly good answer is given 10 points; a particularly bad answer, or no answer, is given 0 points; each essay question counts for 1/6 of the exam.

- The highest possible score on the complete exam is 60 points, the lowest possible score is 0 points.

- We will use the binary grading system with a **tentative threshold** of 30 points for passing the exam: 0-29 points is a fail, 30-60 is a pass (e.g. you will pass if you score at least 5 points on each of the essay questions and has at least one correct answer on each of the 8 MCQ questions; note that this is just an example, **the actual grading and threshold will be set by the course responsible**).<br>



_Side note_: The probability of getting at least 10 points on the MCQ questions **by chance** is non-negligible, i.e. try to solve:

>_For each of 8 MCQ questions with 5 answer options each, 2 of the 5 options are correct. For each question, you will get 3 points for exactly 1 correct answer, 5 points for a maximum of 2 correct answers, and 0 points otherwise. What is the probability of getting 10 points or more by chance across the 8 MCQ questions?_

and remember ....

> All aids are permitted during this home exam. However, please specify precisely which aids you have utilized, and how you used these sources (look-up, search, prompt) in your submitted answers. The exam allows the use of AI to understand and explain medical AI. Be sure to get time to answer the essay questions, as points here will help you to pass the exam. 


**Good luck with your preparation!**
