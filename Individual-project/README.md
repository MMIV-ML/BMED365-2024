# Individual project (BMED365) - poster and speed-poster presentation

According to the course plan [BMED365](https://www4.uib.no/en/courses/BMED365) the second block of the course will focus on computational biomedical imaging (MRI, IMC, ...) and modelling. Between the first and second block, _the students will work on their own individual project, defined by the student henself within the scope of the course_. The output of your project (in the format of a **digital poster** [[suggested template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQOZk9_d-uQzvt4kECEYCK8QbKI5Xt_Ck2s48VBXJo1p_LCylmtW633Y1BTj52BLQCwcUgiD_NYNjIt/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)] [[example using the template](./assets/POSTER_EXAMPLE_2021_MMIV_conf_Tumor_CNR_poster_70x120.pptx)]) must be submitted at Mitt UiB before the end of block two, and your project will thereafter be presented to the rest of the students as a **"speed-poster"**. 

### Guidelines for the Individual project


1. Pick a topic from the BMED 365 curriculum (must incorporate a **computational imaging**, **computational modeling** or an **AI** component) that fits your research interests or evokes your curiosity. The topic could be your own research project, a scientific article, a review of methods with pros and cons, etc. (you can ask for advice regarding topic selection or your planned talk in the early preparation phase).

2. Prepare a poster of the topic [make the title yourself] and a 7-minute presentation, like you are invited to give a speed-talk / speed-poster  at a scientific meeting with a very motivated audience - but who might not be experts in your field.   

3. For this purpose, make a Google Slides (or PowerPoint, or Keynote, or Beamer) _presentation of 7 min duration_ and plan for a _3 min discussion_ with comments & feedback ("peer assessment") with your audience - student mates and possibly others. The digital poster you submitted to Mitt UiB will not be displayed. 

4. You might also write a short manuscript or notes telling what to say during the presentation, but avoid reading directly from your manuscript during the talk, as the notes are meant for rehearsal only.

5. The presentation produced in 3. must be sent/shared as a link on the course Discord bmed365-channel before the session starts.<br>  


6. To guide the speed-poster presentation, **the following criteria should be considered**:
_scientific attitude_, _vocabulary_, and _balanced use of text, tables, and figures_; _clarity in presentation_ regarding problem formulation/introduction, methods description, results (if any), discussion, and conclusions; ability to bring enthusiasm for your topic to the audience; and keeping time.
Remember to share your presentation with your peers before the "speed-poster" session starts (see 5.).<br>

**The Individual project of making a digital poster followed by the "speed-poster" presentation is a compulsory assignment for the course**   


**Note**: In addition to the Individual project, there will be a final digital home [exam](../Exam/README.md) in Inspera (2 hours) with MCQs and essay questions (with a binary grading: pass / fail)
